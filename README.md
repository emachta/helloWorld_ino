# helloWorld_ino



This "Hello World" script was written to power ports 9-13 on the Arduino board. It is a basic for loop sequence to cycle voltage between all 5 ports. I brought LED's and put them in a configuration that read 'hello', and this code allowed me to display the word 'hello' through a really fast sequence.

Enjoy!
